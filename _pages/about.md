I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Brown University, with a specialization in `deep learning` and `computer vision`.

I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University. My studies and research there were centered on health-related problems, biological and biomedical imaging, as well as the broader applications of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning methods. This solid foundation underpins my current advanced research endeavors. I engage in `game development` and technical innovation research. This work goes beyond a mere interest. Collaboratively working in teams, I leverage my technical expertise to design immersive gaming experiences and to develop intelligent AI solutions, reflecting the practical application of my skills in computer science.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have a passion for games, esports, food, photography, and cosplay. These interests offer a creative outlet and a welcome diversion, enriching my life with diverse experiences and perspectives.
