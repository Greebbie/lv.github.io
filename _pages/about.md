I'm a recent Master's graduate in Computer Science from Brown University, where I specialized in `Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning`.

Before that, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Michigan State University, where I developed my skills in deep learning and game development.

Outside of academics, I enjoy snowboarding, games, food, and photography.
