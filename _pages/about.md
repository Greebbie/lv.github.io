I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Brown University, specializing in `artificial intelligence`. Currently, I'm working at Lee lab at Brown. 

I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University, where I worked at the HAAIL lab. I'm skilled in deep learning and game development. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy snowboarding, games, food, and photography.
